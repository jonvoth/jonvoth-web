							<h4>The Westfields Golf Club</h4>
							<p class="text4">At Westfields, Fred Couples has built a course that is fun and accessible for the novice, while challenging and thought-provoking for the experienced golfer. Carved through natural wetlands, rolling hills, and majestic beech and oak trees, Westfields offers golfers a setting that is virtually free from distraction. No residences line its links, creating a course that is truly a golfer's dream. The shotgun start is at 1:30 p.m. – start thinking about your team!</p>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>2. The Great Washington DC Scavenger Hunt</h3>
							<img src="../images/cWar2.jpg" width="200" height="136" class="imgRight">
							<p class="text3">Your mission is to have your team answer as many Scavenger Hunt questions as possible. A professional guide will assist you as your team travels around the National Mall stopping at various monuments and museums to complete the assignment.</p>
							<p class="text3">Each team will be given a list of questions and tasks. Teams will first have to determine their strategy and then find the answers by exploring the museums or monuments on the Mall. They will receive one point for each correctly answered question.</p>
							<p class="text3">But that isn't all! The team must go to the exact location of the answer where a staff person will be waiting with a small "proof-of-finding" souvenir. These may range from a peacock feather for locating the famous Peacock Room by Whistler, to a photo button of the astronauts, given after locating the Apollo spacecraft. They will also get a point for each item that they bring back.</p>
							<p class="text3">A polaroid camera will be provided for each team to obtain various photos such as: funniest looking tourist, most exotic cab driver and most creative group shot. Points will be awarded for the photos. The contest will end back at the hotel where the points will be totaled and prizes awarded.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>3. Welcome to Washington Tour</h3>
							<img src="../images/cWelcome.jpg" width="200" height="165" class="imgRight">
							<p class="text3">Washington DC is one of only three planned federal capitals - George Washington chose this site in 1790. One of the city’s finest tour guides will introduce you to the history and architecture of Washington DC with stories, facts, trivia and perhaps a few old wives tales as you explore monuments, memorials and notable buildings. Along the way, you’ll have the chance to drive by the White House, U.S. Capital, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution Complex and the Washington Monument. You will stop at the national park, which boasts as its centerpieces the Lincoln, Vietnam War and Korean War Veteran’s Memorials. Pause for a photo at the place where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “Dream” speech. Then enjoy a short ride to the Jefferson and FDR Memorials. Enjoy this most beautiful city in the company of your storytelling guide.</p>
							
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<h3>4. War and Remembrance</h3>
							<img src="../images/cWar1.jpg" width="192" height="141" class="imgRight">
							<p class="text3">Begin at Arlington National Cemetery and enjoy a ride through this impressive memorial park, the final resting place of John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, historical figures, Supreme Court justices and many others. Witness the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns. From Arlington, drive to the Marine Corps Memorial to see the largest bronze statue ever cast, the five Marines and a sailor raising the flag on Iwo Jima. Next, is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial with its somber V-shaped black granite walls inscribed with the names of the 58,209 Americans missing or killed in Vietnam. Time permitting, guests may walk to the innovative Korean War Veterans Memorial or pause for a photograph in front of the Lincoln Memorial. You may choose to end the tour by visiting the National WWII Veterans Memorial or by walking through the FDR Memorial.</p>

							<h3>5. Capitol Hill and Inside the Smithsonian</h3>
							<p class="text3">These are separate tours, but will travel to and from Washington DC together.</p>
							<h4>Capitol Hill</h4>
							<img src="../images/cCapitol.jpg" width="120" class="imgRight">

Enter the building to see the stunning Rotunda, Statuary hall, the original House chamber, the crypt, and more. Across the street, visit the seat of the judicial branch, the Supreme Court; you may have the opportunity to witness history in the making if a case is being heard. Next stop is the Library of Congress – housing 535 miles of bookshelves, the contents of Lincoln’s pocket the night he was killed, and more.
