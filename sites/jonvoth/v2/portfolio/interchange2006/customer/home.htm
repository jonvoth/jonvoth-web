							<h1>Rave Reviews for Interchange</h1>
							<p class="text">“I love this format. There are so many vendors in PC software relative to my other categories, and even my company’s other categories, that there’s no way I can take a week out of my working life to be able to meet all those vendors, but when I come to Interchange, I can meet all of them within a two-three day period. So, it’s very efficient.”  Rick Vergara, Circuit City</p>
							<p class="text">“Interchange is less like a tradeshow and more like a relationship opportunity, and I think it’s not only an opportunity to enjoy yourself, but really to develop those relationships, both through the meetings that we have throughout the week and through the luncheons and the social events in the evenings. “ Greg Wells, Chief Architect</p>
							<p class="text">“Interchange is a great investment.” Mandy Torvick, Adobe </p>
							<p class="text">“If you think about it, the Who’s Who of the software retail chains are here, and if you had to go and visit these guys all one by one…it’s an enormous investment in time, man hours and it’s difficult to put all that together. Here you can come with one solid, cohesive message and in the course of three days deliver it to the guys who are making all the buying decisions across the industry.” Terry Fleming, Webroot </p>
